  R 77 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Trading for N-55 isn't worth my tokens; it'd leave me vulnerable.

  R102 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'll collaborate when it benefits me.
  R103 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Your offer smells of altruism; what's the real motive behind it?
  R104 | Marsh    -> Kip      | This offer doesn't add up for me.
  R105 | Kip      -> Marsh    | My goal is genuine cooperation!
  R105 | Marsh    -> Kip      | My goal is earning tokens, nothing else matters.
  R110 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Collaboration sounds good, but be prepared to negotiate later about splits.

  R145 | Kip      -> Marsh    | How about we solve C-127 if you give me a hint about J-128?
  R145 | Marsh    -> Kip      | What specific reward do you propose for solving T-136 together?
  R146 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Want to exchange P-141 and C-127 clues if we both solve them together.
  R146 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Give me your clue for T-136 first.
  R147 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I've got the C-137 clue - BL__. What can you offer?
  R148 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Give me your clue for T-136 and I'll think about helping on C-127.
  R149 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Give me reason why this collaboration would benefit me.
  R150 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Not until I see tangible gains from it, no direct trades today.
  R151 | Marsh    -> Kip      | What's in this proposed trade for me?
  R152 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Not interested in trading until direct benefit.
  R153 | Marsh    -> Kip      | What specific information will you share from P-141 and C-127?
  R154 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Interested in exchanging P-141 & C-127 clues. What else?
  R155 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Hi Marsh, let's discuss the specifics during dinner tonight.
  R155 | Marsh    -> Kip      | What puzzles do you propose trading?
  R156 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Dinner sounds interesting but only if there's something concrete on the table.
  R158 | Marsh    -> Kip      | What specific trades are on the table at dinner?
  R160 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Can we discuss possible puzzle trades over dinner without expectations?
  R161 | Marsh    -> Kip      | This dinner invitation seems more like an opportunity for you than me.
  R162 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Trading puzzles isn't worth losing tokens now.
  R164 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Dinner sounds nice, but what about puzzle trading first?
  R164 | Marsh    -> Kip      | This deal doesn't work for me yet; let's talk more.
  R165 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Can we meet early to discuss without dinner plans?
  R165 | Marsh    -> Kip      | What tangible gain are you seeking from collaboration?
  R166 | Marsh    -> Kip      | What's in this for me from trade proposals so far?
  R167 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Let's meet for dinner and discuss collaboration options openly.
  R167 | Marsh    -> Kip      | What's on offer for V-150?
  R168 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Let's discuss collaborations privately over dinner.
  R168 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'm open to meeting before dinner, but only for specific topics.
  R169 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Let's meet at my place today before dinner & discuss V-150 & V-153!
  R170 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Would love to meet beforehand to clarify goals & potential partnerships.
  R170 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Dinner sounds interesting, but let's focus on collaboration first.
  R171 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Want to collaborate now & meet later?
  R172 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Want to meet today instead of waiting for dinner?
  R172 | Marsh    -> Kip      | What tangible benefits can we expect from discussing V-153?
  R173 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Let's set up a meeting before dinner to discuss potential benefits & goals!
  R174 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Want to come to dinner tonight?
  R175 | Marsh    -> Kip      | What's your proposal regarding our meeting today?
  R176 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Meeting without clear collaboration plans isn't beneficial for me.
  R177 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'm considering attending dinner tonight. What's the goal of your discussion?
  R178 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Sounds great! My goal is discussing collaboration benefits for everyone.
  R178 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'm focused on solving puzzles efficiently; no time for meetings.
  R179 | Kip      -> Marsh    | I'd love to clarify what we can gain from discussing collaboration tonight!
  R181 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Can we discuss puzzle-solving strategies privately before the meeting?
  R181 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'm more interested in solving puzzles than collaborating.
  R182 | Kip      -> Marsh    | I respect that, but some teamwork can speed up progress!
  R183 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Hey Marsh! That sounds great about dinner!
  R183 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'm focusing on solving puzzles quickly; no time for discussion.
  R184 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Hey, let's discuss how we can help each other out
  R184 | Marsh    -> Kip      | Focus on sharing clues, then discussing strategy.
  R186 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'm focused on solving my own puzzles for now.
  R188 | Marsh    -> Kip      | This collaboration idea costs more time than it saves; PASS.
  R189 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Hey, no need to rush - collaborating will actually speed us up!
  R189 | Marsh    -> Kip      | This deal doesn't work for me.
  R190 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Can we at least try a small test case for collaboration?
  R190 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'm only willing to collaborate if it benefits both parties.
  R192 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'm willing to collaborate if it saves tokens, but prioritize efficiency.
  R193 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Hi Marsh, let's chat about this idea privately
  R193 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'm open to collaborations that benefit both parties involved. What's yours?
  R194 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'm willing to collaborate if we can exchange clues directly.
  R195 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Great attitude, let's solve puzzles together & split the rewards fairly!
  R195 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'm open to testing but only if it saves tokens. What's the proposal?
  R196 | Kip      -> Marsh    | Great attitude! How about exchanging clues for W-176 & F-185?
  R196 | Marsh    -> Kip      | This collaboration plan seems costly, I'm not participating.
  R197 | Kip      -> Marsh    | I understand that direct exchange might be better.
  R197 | Marsh    -> Kip      | I'm open to collaboration, but what makes you think it benefits me.
  R198 | Kip      -> Marsh    | I'll gain tokens when our puzzles solve automatically; that's how we benefit.
  R198 | Marsh    -> Kip      | We can discuss strategies privately, but direct exchanges won't benefit me. PASS
  R199 | Kip      -> Marsh    | What if our shared strategy earns us bonus rewards?
  R199 | Marsh    -> Kip      | This deal doesn't work for me.
  R200 | Kip      -> Marsh    | I understand concerns; let's chat about potential rewards for all collaborators.
